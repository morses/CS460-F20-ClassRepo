# Video Game Review Application

Our client wants to build game review application.  They know there are a lot of competitors in this space.  But they assure us they have some great ideas to make this one better than all the others.  From our initial conversations we have the following list of priorities:

1. Focus is on video games but if it is successful they might want to branch out to other products
2. All games for all gamers; no specialization in certain areas. Should cover games for all platforms and from various studios.
3. A web application only -- for now.
4. ...?

Later, after more conversations we've developed a prioritized list of requirements in _user story_ format:

1. As an administrator I want to be able to add a new game into the system so that it will be ready for reviews, ratings, etc.
2. As an administrator I want to characterize a game with a label (such as "first person shooter", "MMO", "strategy" or "rogue-like") so that users will be able to browse, search, or otherwise view games by types.
3. As a reviewer I want to be able to review a game so that others can learn somethings about the game and perhaps decide whether or not to buy it.
4. As a visitor to the site I want to be able to read details about a game so I can learn about it.
4. As a visitor to the site I want to browse a list of games by type so I can learn about the games.
5. As a visitor to the site I want to search for a game by title so I can learn about the game.
6. As a visitor to the site I want to read a review of a game so I can learn even more about it and decide if I want to play it.
7. As a visitor to the site I want to browse a list of games by studio so I can find reviews of them.
8. As a visitor to the site I want to browse a list of recently released games so I can find reviews of them.
9. As a logged-in user I want to be able to rate a review in order to agree with it or not so that the system can build knowledge of the utility of the reviews and the reviewers.
